My favorite actress is Johanna Lumley
I used a burnt sienna crayon to color in the picture
A large goanna bit my arm
Someone I know wears a bandanna every time he goes dancing
Legend tells us belladonna killed Socrates
Ms. Bumbry was never afraid to inhabit the primadonna role offstage
Unlike most fish, a channa can leave the water for a short period of time
Apparently Madonna loathes hydrangeas
The savanna has many lions
I got a henna tattoo of my Chinese name
The Israelites survived on manna during the Exodus
That restaurant has excellent panna cotta
Nanna is an Icelandic singer
Dinna light that candle!
